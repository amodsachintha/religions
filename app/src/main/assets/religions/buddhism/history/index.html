    <p id="P_7">The history of Buddhism is the story of one man's
        spiritual journey to Enlightenment, and of the teachings and ways of
        living that developed from it.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_8">Siddhartha Gautama - The Buddha</h3>
    <p id="P_9">
        By finding the path to Enlightenment, Siddhartha was led from the
        pain of suffering and rebirth towards the path of Enlightenment and
        became known as the <em id="EM_10">Buddha</em> or 'awakened one'.

    <h3 id="H3_14">A life of luxury</h3>
    <p id="P_15">Opinions differ as to the dates of Siddhartha
        Gautama's life. Historians have dated his birth and death as circa
        566-486 BCE but more recent research suggests that he lived later
        than this, from around 490 BCE until circa 410 BCE.</p>
    <p id="P_16">He was born into a royal family in the village of
        Lumbini in present-day Nepal, and his privileged life insulated him
        from the sufferings of life; sufferings such as sickness, age and
        death.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_17">Discovering cruel reality</h3>
    <p id="P_18">One day, after growing up, marrying and having a
        child, Siddhartha went outside the royal enclosure where he lived.
        When he went outside he saw, each for the first time, an old man, a
        sick man, and a corpse.</p>
    <p id="P_19">This greatly disturbed him, and he learned that
        sickness, age, and death were the inevitable fate of human beings -
        a fate no-one could avoid.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_20">Becoming a holy man</h3>
    <p id="P_21">Siddhartha had also seen a monk, and he decided this
        was a sign that he should leave his protected royal life and live as
        a homeless holy man.</p>
    <p id="P_22">Siddhartha's travels showed him much more of the the
        suffering of the world. He searched for a way to escape the
        inevitability of death, old age and pain first by studying with
        religious men. This didn't provide him with an answer.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_23">A life of self-denial</h3>
    <p id="P_24">Siddhartha encountered an Indian ascetic who
        encouraged him to follow a life of extreme self-denial and
        discipline.</p>
    <p id="P_25">The Buddha also practised meditation but concluded
        that in themselves, the highest meditative states were not enough.</p>
    <p id="P_26">Siddhartha followed this life of extreme asceticism
        for six years, but this did not satisfy him either; he still had not
        escaped from the world of suffering.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_27">The middle way</h3>
    <p id="P_28">He abandoned the strict lifestyle of self-denial and
        ascetism, but did not return to the pampered luxury of his early
        life.</p>
    <p id="P_29">Instead, he pursued the Middle Way, which is just
        what it sounds like; neither luxury nor poverty.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_30">Enlightenment</h3>

    <p id="P_35">One day, seated beneath the Bodhi tree (the tree of
        awakening) Siddhartha became deeply absorbed in meditation, and
        reflected on his experience of life, determined to penetrate its
        truth.</p>
    <p id="P_36">He finally achieved Enlightenment and became the
        Buddha. The Mahabodhi Temple at the site of Buddha's enlightenment,
        is now a pilgrimage site.</p>
    <p id="P_37">Buddhist legend tells that at first the Buddha was
        happy to dwell within this state, but Brahma, king of the gods,
        asked, on behalf of the whole world, that he should share his
        understanding with others.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_38">The Teacher</h3>
    <p id="P_39">
        Buddha set in motion the <em id="EM_40">wheel of teaching</em>:
        rather than worshipping one god or gods, Buddhism centres around the
        timeless importance of the teaching, or the <em id="EM_41">dharma</em>.
    </p>
    <p id="P_42">
        For the next 45 years of his life the Buddha taught many disciples,
        who became <em id="EM_43">Arahants</em> or 'noble ones', who had
        attained Enlightenment for themselves.
