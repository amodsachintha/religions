            <p>"I teach suffering, its origin, cessation and path.
                That's all I teach", declared the Buddha 2500 years ago.</p>
            <p id="P_12">The Four Noble Truths contain the essence of the
                Buddha's teachings. It was these four principles that the Buddha
                came to understand during his meditation under the bodhi tree.</p>

            <p>The Buddha is often compared to a physician. In the
                first two Noble Truths he diagnosed the problem (suffering) and
                identified its cause. The third Noble Truth is the realisation that
                there is a cure.</p>
            <p>The fourth Noble Truth, in which the Buddha set out
                the Eightfold Path, is the prescription, the way to achieve a
                release from suffering.</p>

                            <h3 id="H3_26">Suffering (Dukkha)</h3>
                            <p id="P_27">Suffering comes in many forms. Three obvious kinds
                                of suffering correspond to the first three sights the Buddha saw on
                                his first journey outside his palace: old age, sickness and death.</p>
                            <p id="P_28">But according to the Buddha, the problem of
                                suffering goes much deeper. Life is not ideal: it frequently fails
                                to live up to our expectations.</p>
                            <p id="P_29">Human beings are subject to desires and cravings,
                                but even when we are able to satisfy these desires, the satisfaction
                                is only temporary. Pleasure does not last; or if it does, it becomes
                                monotonous.</p>
                            <p id="P_30">Even when we are not suffering from outward causes
                                like illness or bereavement, we are unfulfilled, unsatisfied. This
                                is the truth of suffering.</p>
                            <p id="P_31">Some people who encounter this teaching may find it
                                pessimistic. Buddhists find it neither optimistic nor pessimistic,
                                but realistic. Fortunately the Buddha's teachings do not end with
                                suffering; rather, they go on to tell us what we can do about it and
                                how to end it.</p>

                            <p id="P_42">Our day-to-day troubles may seem to have easily
                                identifiable causes: thirst, pain from an injury, sadness from the
                                loss of a loved one. In the second of his Noble Truths, though, the
                                Buddha claimed to have found the cause of all suffering - and it is
                                much more deeply rooted than our immediate worries.</p>
                            <p id="P_43">
                                The Buddha taught that the root of all suffering is desire, <em
                                    id="EM_44">tanhÄ?</em>. This comes in three forms, which he
                                described as the Three Roots of Evil, or the Three Fires, or the
                                Three Poisons.

            <h2>Karma</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p id="P_7">Karma is a concept encountered in several Eastern
                religions, although having different meanings.</p>
            <p id="P_8">Teachings about karma explain that our past actions
                affect us, either positively or negatively, and that our present
                actions will affect us in the future.</p>
            <p id="P_9">Buddhism uses an agricultural metaphor to explain how
                sowing good or bad deeds will result in good or bad fruit (phala; or
                vipÄ?ka, meaning 'ripening').</p>
            <h3 id="H3_14">Solely through our actions?</h3>
            <p id="P_15">Early Buddhist writings (particularly SN 36.21: see
                related links for an annotated translation) suggest that not all
                that we experience is the result of past action; it may be due to
                natural events of one sort or another. This is one point on which
                early Buddhism appears to differ somewhat from later Tibetan
                teachings, which suggest that all the good and bad things that
                happen to us are the results of past actions.</p>
            <p id="P_16">Whilst there might be doubt, or different opinions,
                about why we are experiencing some sort of misfortune, there is no
                doubt that we can resolve any suffering in the present moment
                through the Buddhist teachings of mindfulness and action based upon
                good motives.</p>
            <h3 id="H3_17">Beyond this life</h3>
            <p id="P_18">For Buddhists, karma has implications beyond this
                life. Bad actions in a previous life can follow a person into their
                next life and cause bad effects (which Westerners are more likely to
                interpret as 'bad luck').</p>
            <p id="P_19">Even an Enlightened One is not exempt from the
                effects of past karma. One story tells that the Buddha's cousin
                tried to kill him by dropping a boulder on him. Although the attempt
                failed, the Buddha's foot was injured. He explained that this was
                karmic retribution for trying to kill his step-brother in a previous
                life.</p>
            <p id="P_20">On a larger scale, karma determines where a person
                will be reborn and their status in their next life. Good karma can
                result in being born in one of the heavenly realms. Bad karma can
                cause rebirth as an animal, or torment in a hell realm.</p>
            <p id="P_21">Buddhists try to cultivate good karma and avoid bad.
                However, the aim of Buddhism is to escape the cycle of rebirth
                altogether, not simply to acquire good karma and so to be born into
                a more pleasant state. These states, while preferable to human life,
                are impermanent: even gods eventually die.</p>
            <h3 id="H3_22">Self-determined</h3>
            <p id="P_23">The word karma means 'action', and this indicates
                something important about the concept of karma: it is determined by
                our own actions, in particular by the motives behind intentional
                actions.</p>
            <p id="P_24">Skilful actions that lead to good karmic outcomes
                are based upon motives of generosity; compassion, kindness and
                sympathy, and clear mindfulness or wisdom. The opposite motives of
                greed, aversion (hatred) and delusion, when acted upon, lead to bad
                karmic results.</p>
            <p id="P_25">Karma is not an external force, not a system of
                punishment or reward dealt out by a god. The concept is more
                accurately understood as a natural law similar to gravity.</p>
            <p id="P_26">Buddhists believe we are in control of our ultimate
                fates. The problem is that most of us are ignorant of this, which
                causes suffering. The purpose of Buddhism is to take conscious
                control of our behaviour.</p>

            <h3 id="H3_30">Moral habits</h3>
            <p>The Buddha taught about karmic 'conditioning', which
                is a process by which a person's nature is shaped by their moral
                actions.</p>
            <p>Every action we take molds our characters for the
                future. Both positive and negative traits can become magnified over
                time as we fall into habits. All of these cause us to acquire karma.
            </p>
            <p>This shows why Buddhists place such importance on
                being mindful of every action they take.</p>
            <h3>Getting rid of karmic conditioning</h3>
            <p>Acting on karmic habits increases their strength.
                Buddhists gradually weaken any negative thoughts and impulses that
                they experience, through allowing them to arise and depart naturally
                without acting on them.</p>
            <p>In this way karmic habits can be broken.</p>
            <h3>Rebirth and disability</h3>
            <p>This view of the world can raise a particularly
                charged question. Do Buddhists believe that disabled people are
                suffering for misdeeds in a past life?</p>
            <p>The subject is more complicated than it appears,
                says the Venerable Robina Courtin, a Tibetan Buddhist nun, in this
                radio discussion on religious attitudes to disability.</p>

                The great tragedy of existence, from a Buddhist point of view, is
                that it is both endless and subject to impermanence, suffering and
                uncertainty. These three are called the <em id="EM_12">tilakhana</em>
                or three signs of existence.
            </p>
            <p id="P_13">Existence is endless because individuals are
                reincarnated over and over again, experiencing suffering throughout
                many lives.</p>
            <p id="P_14">It is impermanent because no state, good or bad,
                lasts forever. Our mistaken belief that things can last is a chief
                cause of suffering.</p>
            <p>It is uncertain because when we examine our
                experience, no knower can be defined and no enduring essence of
                experience can be located.</p>
            <p>
                Only achieving liberation, or <em id="EM_17">nirvana</em>, can free
                a being from the cycle of life, death and rebirth.
            </p>
            <h3 id="H3_18">The realms</h3>
            <p>Buddhism has six realms into which a soul can be
                reborn. From most to least pleasant, these are:</p>
            <ul id="UL_20">
                <li id="LI_21">Heaven, the home of the gods (<em id="EM_22">devas</em>):
                    this is a realm of enjoyment inhabited by blissful, long-lived
                    beings. It is subdivided by later sources into 26 levels of
                    increasing happiness
                </li>
                <li>The realm of humanity: although humans suffer,
                    this is considered the most fortunate state because humans have the
                    greatest chance of enlightenment
                </li>
                <li>The realm of the Titans or angry gods (<em
                        id="EM_25">asuras</em>): these are warlike beings who are at the
                    mercy of angry impulses
                </li>
                <li id="LI_26">The realm of the hungry ghosts (<em id="EM_27">pretas</em>):
                    these unhappy beings are bound to the fringes of human existence,
                    unable to leave because of particularly strong attachments. They
                    are unable to satisfy their craving, symbolised by their depiction
                    with huge bellies and tiny mouths
                </li>
                <li id="LI_28">The animal realm: this is undesirable because
                    animals are exploited by human beings, and do not have the
                    necessary self-awareness to achieve liberation
                </li>
                <li id="LI_29">Hell realms: people here are horribly tortured
                    in many creative ways, but not for ever - only until their bad
                    karma is worked off
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>(Early sources listed five realms, excluding the
                Titans.)</p>
            <p >The first two levels are good places to be born. The
                inhabitants of the next three levels all have a particular defect
                (hatred, greed, ignorance), and hell is obviously the worst of the
                lot.</p>
