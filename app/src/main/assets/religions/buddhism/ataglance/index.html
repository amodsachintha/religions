    <br>
    <p>Buddhism is a spiritual tradition that focuses on
        personal spiritual development and the attainment of a deep insight
        into the true nature of life. There are 376 million followers
        worldwide.</p>
    <p>
        Buddhists seek to reach a state of <em id="EM_13">nirvana</em>,
        following the path of the Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, who went on a
        quest for Enlightenment around the sixth century BC.
    </p>
    <p>There is no belief in a personal god. Buddhists
        believe that nothing is fixed or permanent and that change is always
        possible. The path to Enlightenment is through the practice and
        development of morality, meditation and wisdom.</p>
    <p>
        Buddhists believe that life is both endless and subject to
        impermanence, suffering and uncertainty. These states are called the
        <em>tilakhana</em>, or the three signs of existence.
        Existence is endless because individuals are reincarnated over and
        over again, experiencing suffering throughout many lives.
    </p>
    <p>It is impermanent because no state, good or bad,
        lasts forever. Our mistaken belief that things can last is a chief
        cause of suffering.</p>
    <p>
        <a href="file:///android_asset/religions/buddhism/history/index.html">The history of
            Buddhism</a> is the story of one man's
        spiritual journey to enlightenment, and of the teachings and ways of
        living that developed from it.

    <h5>The Buddha</h5>
    <p>Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha, was born into a
        royal family in present-day Nepal over 2500 years ago. He lived a
        life of privilege and luxury until one day he left the royal
        enclosure and encountered for the first time, an old man, a sick
        man, and a corpse. Disturbed by this he became a monk before
        adopting the harsh poverty of Indian asceticism. Neither path
        satisfied him and he decided to pursue the ‘Middle Way’ - a life
        without luxury but also without poverty.</p>
    <p>Buddhists believe that one day, seated beneath the
        Bodhi tree (the tree of awakening), Siddhartha became deeply
        absorbed in meditation and reflected on his experience of life until
        he became enlightened.</p>
    <p>By finding the path to enlightenment, Siddhartha was
        led from the pain of suffering and rebirth towards the path of
        enlightenment and became known as the Buddha or 'awakened one'.</p>
    <h5>Schools of Buddhism</h5>
    <p>
        There are numerous different schools or sects of Buddhism. The two
        largest are Theravada Buddhism, which is most popular in Sri
        Lanka, Cambodia, Thailand, Laos and Burma (Myanmar), and Mahayana Buddhism, which is strongest in Tibet,
        China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, and Mongolia.
