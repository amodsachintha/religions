    <h2 class="heading-nth-1" id="H2_6">First atheist writers</h2>
    <p id="P_7">Most histories of atheism choose the Greek and Roman
        philosophers Epicurus, Democritus, and Lucretius as the first
        atheist writers. While these writers certainly changed the idea of
        God, they didn't entirely deny that gods could exist.</p>

    <h3 id="H3_10">Epicurus</h3>
    <p id="P_11">Epicurus put forward the theory of "materialism":
        The only things that exist are bodies and the space between them.</p>
    <p id="P_12">Epicurus taught that the soul is also made of
        material objects, and so when the body dies the soul dies with it.
        There is no afterlife.</p>
    <p id="P_13">Epicurus thought that gods might exist, but if they
        did, they did not have anything to do with human beings.</p>
    <p id="P_14">Religion was the human activity of trying to live in
        the way such noble (but unknowable) gods might live.</p>

            <p id="P_17">
                The soul cannot survive separation from the body, since it is
                necessary to understand that it too is a part.<br id="BR_18"/>
                By itself the soul cannot ever either exist (even though Plato and
                the Stoics talk a great deal of nonsense on the subject) or
                experience movement, just as the body does not possess sensation
                when the soul is released from it.

    <h3 id="H3_20">Lucretius</h3>
    <p id="P_21">Lucretius did not deny the existence of gods either,
        but he felt that human ideas about gods combined with the fear of
        death to make human beings unhappy.</p>
    <p id="P_22">He followed the same materialist lines as Epicurus,
        and by denying that the gods had any way of influencing our world he
        said that humankind had no need to fear the supernatural.</p>

    <h2>The discovery of evolution</h2>
    <h3 id="H3_7">Science begins to undermine religion</h3>
    <span><img

            src="file:///android_asset/religions/atheism/history/images/darwin.jpg"

					Darwin at the time of the publication of The Origin of Species in
					1859
			</span></span>
    <p>In the second half of the 19th century the theory of
        evolution put forward by Charles Darwin, and other scientific
        discoveries, undermined the value of religion as a way of explaining
        the nature and existence of the world.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_13">Theology and Bible scholarship</h3>
    <p>During the 18th and 19th centuries, academic
        research began to undermine the literal truths of religion and throw
        doubt on the existence of God as a separate supernatural being.</p>
    <p id="P_15">
        The philosopher Thomas Hobbes had noted even earlier, in 1651, that
        Mose could not actually have written all the books
        of the Bible that were attributed to him.
    </p>
    <span class="image_with_caption float_left" id="SPAN_18"><img
            alt="Thomas Hobbes" height="100"
            src="file:///android_asset/religions/atheism/history/images/hobbes.jpg"
            width="100" id="IMG_19"/> <span class="caption" id="SPAN_20">Thomas
					Hobbes
			</span></span>
    <p>In 1779 J G Eichhorn suggested that the stories in
        the Book of Genesis, were not actual history, but were myths, like
        the stories of Greek and Roman mythology. Furthermore, he said,
        these stories should no longer be read as if they were the actual
        word of God.</p>
    <p id="P_23">Other theologians began to work with the ideas of
        Hegel to portray religion, and religious stories and beliefs in
        general, as symbolic ways of demonstrating truths about the
        spiritual life of humankind.</p>
    <p id="P_24">Literary analysis of the text began to cast great
        doubt on the Bible itself as a reliable historical document.</p>
    <p id="P_25">The German, D F Strauss, said in 1835 that the New
        Testament stories about Christ should not be interpreted as
        literally true, but as a dress of religious symbolism clothing the
        life of of a Jewish teacher.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_26">God is a human invention</h3>
    <p>In 1841 Ludwig Feuerbach argued that God was a human
        invention, a spiritual device to help us deal with our fears and
        aspirations.</p>
    <span class="image_with_caption float_left" id="SPAN_28"><img
            alt="Ludwig Feuerbach" height="120"
            src="file:///android_asset/religions/atheism/history/images/feuerbach.jpg"
            width="90" id="IMG_29"/> <span class="caption" id="SPAN_30">Ludwig
					Feuerbach
			</span></span>
    <p id="P_32">This was bad news, because human beings projected
        all their good qualities onto God and saw him as compassionate,
        wise, loving and so on, while they saw themselves as greatly
        inferior. Thus humanity alienated itself from its true self.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_33">Anthropology</h3>
    <p id="P_34">Anthropologists, too, were casting doubt on previous
        certainties.</p>
    <p id="P_35">Research into comparative religion revealed that
        there was a great deal of similarity between the rituals and stories
        of many religions - even tribal religions seemed to have elements in
        common with Christianity.</p>
    <p id="P_36">This posed the big problem of how Christianity (or
        any other religion) could claim that it was the only true faith, and
        how any religion could claim to be the unique result of God's
        revelation, since all religions seemed to share so much in common.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_37">Nietzsche</h3>
    <p id="P_38">At the end of the 19th century the philosopher
        Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) announced that God was dead, and
        that humanity had killed him.</p>
    <span class="image_with_caption float_right" id="SPAN_39"><img
            alt="Friedrich Nietzsche" height="110"
            src="file:///android_asset/religions/atheism/history/images/nietzsche.jpg"
            width="90" id="IMG_40"/> <span class="caption" id="SPAN_41">Friedrich
					Nietzsche
			</span></span>
    <p id="P_43">Nietzsche said that it was no longer possible to
        believe in the Christian God. Modern people, he thought, did not
        really believe in God any more and it was this unbelief that had
        killed off God.</p>
    <p id="P_44">This had serious ethical consequences. Western
        society's entire moral code was based on Judaeo-Christian ethics,
        and sooner or later people would realise that if they no longer
        believed in God, they could not live by a moral code that was based
        on God.</p>
    <p id="P_45">Nietzsche wasn't just proclaiming the death of God,
        but something even more radical - for Nietzsche there was nothing
        left to believe in, certainly not God, but not even any external
        world that might provide a source of meaning and purpose for
        humanity.</p>
    <p id="">Nietzsche was particularly critical of Christianity.
        He thought that it was not only false but depraved and corrupt, a
        "contradiction of life".</p>
