        an atheist</h2>
    <h3 id="H3_7">Intellectual</h3>
    <p id="P_8">Most atheists would offer some of the following
        arguments as their reason for deciding that God doesn't exist.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_9">Non-Intellectual</h3>
    <p id="P_10">Many people are atheists because of the way they
        were brought up or educated, or because they have simply adopted the
        beliefs of the culture in which they grew up. So someone raised in
        Communist China is likely to have no belief in God because the
        education system and culture make being an atheist the natural thing
        to do.</p>
    <p id="P_11">Other people are atheists because they just feel
        that atheism is right.</p>

        this article in an extremely simplified way and are intended only as
        a starting point for further reading and exploration.</p>

    <p id="P_27">Many people are atheists because they think there is
        no evidence for God's existence - or at least no reliable evidence.
        They argue that a person should only believe in things for which
        they have good evidence.</p>
    <p id="P_28">A philosopher might say that they start from the
        presumption of atheism.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_29">The presumption of Atheism</h3>
    <p id="P_30">This is an argument about where to begin the
        discussion of whether or not God exists.</p>
    <p id="P_31">It says that we should assume that God does not
        exist, and put the onus on people who believe in God to to prove
        that God does exist.</p>
    <p id="P_32">The philosopher Anthony Flew who wrote an article on
        this said:</p>
    <div class="promo_quote_box_top" id="DIV_33">
        <blockquote id="BLOCKQUOTE_34">
            <p id="P_35">
                If it is to be established that there is a God, then we have to
                have good grounds for believing that this is indeed so.<br
                    id="BR_36"/> Until and unless some such grounds are produced we
                have literally no reason at all for believing; and in that
                situation the only reasonable posture must be that of either the
                negative atheist or the agnostic.<br id="BR_37"/> So the onus of
                proof has to rest on the proposition.<br id="BR_38"/> It must be
                up to them: first, to give whatever sense they choose to the word
                'God', meeting any objection that so defined it would relate only
                to an incoherent pseudo-concept; and, second, to bring forward
                sufficient reasons to warrant their claim that, in their present
                sense of the word 'God', there is a God.<br id="BR_39"/>

    <h2 id="H2_46">Reasons that treat God as unnecessary</h2>
    <h3 id="H3_47">Science explains everything</h3>
    <p id="P_48">Atheists argue that because everything in the
        universe can be explained in a satisfactory way without using God as
        part of the explanation, then there is no point in saying that God
        exists.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_49">Occam's Razor</h3>
    <p id="P_50">The argument is based on a philosophical idea called
        Occam's Razor, popularised by William of Occam in the 14th century.
    </p>
    <p id="P_51">
        In Latin it goes <em id="EM_52">Pluralitas non est ponenda sine
        necessitate</em> or in English... "Entities should not be multiplied
        unnecessarily".
    </p>
    <p id="P_53">This is usually simplified to say that the simplest
        answer is the best answer.</p>
    <p id="P_54">Therefore atheists might argue that since the entire
        universe, and all of creation can be explained by evolution and
        scientific cosmology, we don't need the existence of another entity
        called God.</p>
    <p id="P_55">Therefore God doesn't exist.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_56">What would William have said?</h3>
    <p id="P_57">William of Occam would not have agreed; he was a
        Franciscan monk who never doubted the existence of God.</p>
    <p id="P_58">But in his century he wasn't breaking the rule named
        after him. 14th century science knew nothing about evolution or how
        the universe came into being. God was the only explanation
        available.</p>
    <p id="P_59">What William would think if he lived now is another
        matter...</p>

    <h2 id="H2_65">Arguments for God aren't convincing</h2>
    <h3 id="H3_66">Weakness of the proofs that God exists</h3>
    <p id="P_67">There are a number of traditional arguments used to
        prove that God exists; however, none of them convinces atheists.
        Here they are:</p>
    <h3 id="H3_68">The Argument from Design</h3>
    <p id="P_69">The universe is such a beautiful and orderly thing
        that it must have been designed. Only God could have designed it.
        Therefore since the universe exists, God must exist.</p>
    <p id="P_70">An atheist might refute this by saying that,
        actually, the universe is not particularly beautiful and orderly.
        And even if it was, why should there be a designer? And modern
        science shows that most of the natural things we think of as
        designed are just the products of processes like evolution.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_71">The "Ontological" Argument</h3>
    <p id="P_72">We think of God as a perfect being. If God didn't
        exist he wouldn't be perfect. God is perfect, therefore God exists.
    </p>
    <p id="P_73">Most atheists think this argument is so feeble they
        don't bother dealing with it.</p>
    <p id="P_74">Professional philosophers usually reject it on the
        grounds that existence is not a property of beings.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_75">The First Cause Argument</h3>
    <p id="P_76">Everything that happens has a cause. Therefore the
        universe must have had a cause. That cause must have been God.
        Therefore since the universe exists, God must exist in order to have
        caused it to exist.</p>
    <p id="P_77">An atheist might respond by asking what caused God.
        (And what caused the cause of God, and so on.) The argument might
        proceed that if God didn't need a cause, then maybe the universe
        didn't need a cause either. If God was already perfect before he
        created the universe, why did he create it? How did it benefit him?
        Why would he bother? And if the universe was caused, perhaps
        something other than God caused it?</p>

    <h2 id="H2_83">The problem of evil</h2>
    <h3 id="H3_84">The Argument from Evil</h3>
    <p id="P_85">The existence of evil seems inconsistent with the
        existence of a God who is wholly good, and can do anything.</p>
    <p id="P_86">The argument goes like this:</p>
    <p id="P_87">Most religions say that God is completely good,
        knows everything, and is all-powerful. But the world is full of
        wickedness and bad things keep happening. This can only happen if...
    </p>
    <ul id="UL_88">
        <li id="LI_89">God is unwilling to prevent evil, in which case
            he is not good or
        </li>
        <li id="LI_90">God doesn't know about evil, in which case he
            does not know everything or
        </li>
        <li id="LI_91">God can't prevent evil, in which case he is not
            all powerful or
        </li>
        <li id="LI_92">Some combination of the above</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="P_93">And so there is no being that is completely good,
        knows everything, and is all powerful. And so, there is no God.</p>
    <p id="P_94">Theologians and philosophers have provided various
        answers to this argument. They all agree that it gives useful
        insights into the nature of God, evil, and belief.</p>

    <h2 id="H2_100">Reasons to do with science and the history of
        thought</h2>
    <h3 id="H3_101">The best explanation</h3>
    <p id="P_102">For most of human history God was the best
        explanation for the existence and nature of the physical universe.</p>
    <p id="P_103">But during the last few centuries, scientists have
        developed solutions that are much more logical, more consistent, and
        better supported by evidence.</p>
    <p id="P_104">Atheists say that these explain the world so much
        better than the existence of God.They also say that far from God
        being a good explanation for the world, it's God that now requires
        explaining.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_105">Before science</h3>
    <p id="P_106">In olden times - and still today in some
        traditional societies - natural phenomena that people didn't
        understand, such as the weather, sunrise and sunset, and so on, were
        seen as the work of gods or spirits.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_107">Bible times</h3>
    <p id="P_108">The Old Testament portrays the world as something
        controlled by God.</p>
    <p id="P_109">Where we would see the weather as obeying
        meteorological principles, people in those days saw it as
        demonstrating God at work. And it was the same with all the other
        natural phenomena, they just showed God doing things.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_110">The Greeks</h3>
    <div class="promo_quote_box_top" id="DIV_111">
        <blockquote id="BLOCKQUOTE_112">
            <p id="P_113">Everything is full of Gods</p>
            <p id="P_114">
                <cite id="CITE_115">Thales (624-546 BCE), Greek philosopher</cite>
            </p>
        </blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="promo_quote_box_bottom" id="DIV_116"></div>
    <p id="P_117">The Greek philosopher Thales moved things on by
        suggesting that the gods were actually an essential part of things,
        rather than external puppeteers pulling strings to make the world
        work.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_118">Myth and magic</h3>
    <p id="P_119">But there was more to these ancient explanations
        than gods doing things in or to the world. People saw the whole
        universe in a religiously structured way; they had no other way to
        see it at that time.</p>
    <p id="P_120">For the ancients, God provided the power that made
        the universe work, and God provided the structure within which the
        universe worked and human beings lived.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_121">Astrology</h3>
    <p id="P_122">Ideas like that survive in modern astrology. Many
        people believe that their lives are in some way influenced by the
        movements of heavenly bodies. And the heavenly bodies concerned have
        names taken from mythology and religion.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_123">Modern religion</h3>
    <p id="P_124">And you'll find similar ideas in most popular
        religious thinking. Many people still believe, or want to believe,
        in the idea of God as puppeteer.</p>
    <p id="P_125">They believe that God is able to do things in the
        world: he can divide the waters of the Red Sea to save the
        Israelites from Pharaoh, he can respond to prayer by healing an
        illness or getting someone through an exam.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_126">Cosmology</h3>
    <p id="P_127">Cosmology is the study of the origin and nature of
        the universe.</p>
    <p id="P_128">Nowadays it's a branch of astronomy and physics,
        but in pre-scientific times it was a religious subject, organising
        the universe in terms of almost military ranks of beings. God was at
        the top, and human beings came pretty much at the bottom.</p>
    <p id="P_129">In some cosmologies there was also an inverted
        hierarchy of evil beings going down from humanity to the source of
        wickedness, the devil, at the bottom.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_130">Power</h3>
    <p id="P_131">These religious cosmologies were rigid; each being
        had its place worked out for it in the structure that God had
        provided, and that was where it stayed.</p>
    <p id="P_132">Looking at the universe like this provided great
        support for the hierarchical power structures of earthly nations and
        tribes: Everyone in a nation or tribe had their place, and the power
        came from the top.</p>
    <p id="P_133">And if God had decided to organise the universe in
        such a hierarchy, this provided a strong argument against anyone who
        wanted to suggest that society could be organised in a fairer and
        more equal way - God had shown us the perfect way to organise
        things, and those who were ruling did so by a right given by God.</p>
    <p id="P_134">It was also very good news for whichever religion
        was followed in a particular nation: since the power all came from
        God, religion was bound to be given high status.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_135">The mechanical universe</h3>
    <p id="P_136">The idea that God steered everything in the
        universe as he saw fit was demolished by the discovery that there
        were natural laws obeyed by objects in the universe.</p>
    <p id="P_137">Galileo, for example, discovered that the universe
        followed laws that could be written down mathematically.</p>
    <p id="P_138">This suggested that there was logic and engineering
        throughout creation. The universe behaved in a consistent manner and
        was not subject to gods pulling a string here and there, or some
        unexplained influences from astrological bodies.</p>
    <p id="P_139">This didn't give Galileo any religious problems
        (although it annoyed the church greatly and they eventually made him
        keep quiet about some of his conclusions) because he believed that
        God had written the scientific rules.</p>
    <p id="P_140">And around this time scientists began to come up
        with new ways of assessing whether certain things were true. Things
        were expected to happen in a repeatable, testable way, that could be
        written down in equations.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_141">God the engineer</h3>
    <p id="P_142">Although scientific discovery began to explain more
        and more, it didn't cause large numbers of people to become less
        religious.</p>
    <p id="P_143">Even many - probably most - scientists still had a
        place for God in the universe. At the very least, he had started the
        whole thing going, and he had created the rules that his universe
        was shown to obey.</p>
    <p id="P_144">This half-way house between religion and science
        still had problems for the faithful, since it didn't seem to leave
        much room for God to intervene in the universe - and certainly it
        didn't need God to keep things ticking over.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_145">God the creator</h3>
    <p id="P_146">But the half-way house also provided some support
        for the faithful. They could look at the universe and see how
        beautifuly made it was, and be reassured that God had demonstrated
        his existence by creating such a wonderful place.</p>
    <p id="P_147">And since science, until the late 18th, and 19th
        centuries, hadn't produced any good explanation of how things began,
        religion still had an important place in explaining how the world
        was the way it was.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_148">God takes a back seat</h3>
    <p id="P_149">God's role as an explanation for the way things are
        took a serious knock from the sciences of geology and evolution.</p>
    <p id="P_150">Geologists discovered that the earth was hundreds
        of millions of years old, and not just 6,000 years old as was
        generally believed at that time.</p>
    <p id="P_151">They showed that the rocks that make up the earth
        had been laid down in layers at different times; a deeper layer (by
        and large) came from an earlier time than a shallow layer.</p>
    <p id="P_152">In each layer were fossils that showed that
        different species of animals had lived in different eras. Not only
        were many no longer in existence but some didn't appear until
        relatively recent times.</p>
    <p id="P_153">This was incompatible with the idea that God
        completely created the world in 6 days and so scientists with a
        faith came up with another compromise - the 6 days of biblical
        creation were a poetic way of describing long periods of millions of
        years during which God worked on the world.</p>

    <p id="P_161">The theory of evolution explains the variety of
        life forms on earth without any reference to God.</p>
    <p id="P_162">It says that from very simple beginnings, processes
        of genetic variation and selection (i.e. new forms of life keep
        appearing, and some forms of life don't survive and become extinct),
        working for hundreds of millions of years, generated the range of
        plants and animals that exist today.</p>
    <p id="P_163">These processes are not directed by any being, they
        are just the way the world works; God is unnecessary.</p>

                run). No vital forces propel evolutionary change. And whatever we
                think of God, his existence is not manifest in the products of
                nature.</p>

    <h2 id="H2_174">Reasons that treat God as meaningless</h2>
    <h3 id="H3_175">Relative philosophy</h3>
    <p id="P_176">Some philosophers think that religious language
        doesn't mean anything at all, and therefore that there's no point in
        asking whether God exists.</p>
    <p id="P_177">They would say that a sentence like "In the
        beginning God created the heavens and the earth" is neither true or
        false, it's meaningless; in the same way that "colourless green
        ideas sleep furiously" is meaningless.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_178">Logical Positivism, or Verificationism</h3>
    <p id="P_179">Logical Positivists argued that a sentence was
        meaningless if it wasn't either true or false, and they said that a
        sentence would only be true or false if it could be tested by an
        experiment, or if it was true by definition.</p>
    <p id="P_180">A more accurate version of this idea can be found
        here:</p>
    <p id="P_181">Since you couldn't verify the existence of God by
        any sort of "sense experience", and it wasn't true by definition (eg
        in the way "a triangle has 3 sides" is true), the logical
        positivists argued that it was pointless asking the question since
        it could not be answered true or false.</p>
    <p id="P_182">These particular philosophers didn't only say that
        religious talk was meaningless, they thought that much of
        philosophical discussion, metaphysics for example, was meaningless
        too. This philosophical theory is no longer popular, and attention
        has returned to the issues of what "God" means and whether "God"
        exists.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_183">Note for philosophers</h3>
    <p id="P_184">This is how one prominent philosopher put it:</p>
    <div class="promo_quote_box_top" id="DIV_185">
        <blockquote id="BLOCKQUOTE_186">
            <p id="P_187">We say that a sentence is factually significant
                to any given person, if and only if, he knows how to verify the
                proposition which it purports to express - that is, if he knows
                what observations would lead him, under certain conditions, to
                accept the proposition as being true, or reject is as being false.

            <p id="P_201">For if the existence of such a god were probable,

                it, and other empirical hypotheses, certain experiential
                propositions which were not deducible from those other hypotheses

            <p id="P_202">But in fact this is not possible...For to say

    </h2>
    <h3 id="H3_213">Psychological explanations of religon</h3>
    <p id="P_214">Psychologists have long been fascinated by religion
        as something that exists in all societies.</p>
    <p id="P_215">They ask whether 'religion' is actually a name
        given to various psychological drives, rather than a response to the
        existence of God or gods.</p>
    <p id="P_216">Such a belief is clearly atheistic.</p>
    <p id="P_217">Religion, to the common man, is a:</p>

                hand explains to him the riddles of this world with enviable
                completeness, and, on the other, assures him that a careful
                Providence will watch over his life and will compensate him in a

    <h3 id="H3_224">Religion comes from emotions</h3>
    <p id="P_225">Human beings believe in God because they want:</p>
    <ul id="UL_226">
        <li id="LI_227">A father figure to protect them from this
            frightening world
        </li>
        <li id="LI_228">Someone who gives their lives meaning and
            purpose
        </li>
        <li id="LI_229">Something that stops death being the end</li>
        <li id="LI_230">To believe that they are an important part of
            the universe, and that some component of the universe (God) cares
            for and respects them
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p id="P_231">These beliefs are strongly held because they enable
        human beings to cope with some of their most basic fears.</p>
    <p id="P_232">Atheists argue that since religion is just a
        psychological fantasy, human beings should abandon it so that they
        can grow to respond appropriately to deal with the world as it is.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_233">Freud</h3>
    <p id="P_234">Sigmund Freud tackled religion in great detail and
        had several ideas about it.</p>
    <p id="P_235">One of his theories was that religion stems from
        the individual's experience of having been a helpless baby totally
        dependent on its parents. The infant sees its parents as
        all-powerful beings who show it great love and satisfy all its
        needs. This experience is almost identical to the way human beings
        portray their relationship with God.</p>
    <p id="P_236">Freud also suggested that childhood experiences
        caused people to have very complex feelings about their parents and
        themselves, and religion and religious rituals provide a respectable
        mechanism for working these out.</p>
    <p id="P_237">Freud also described religion as a mass-delusion
        that reshaped reality to provide a certainty of happiness and a
        protection from suffering.</p>

    <h2 id="H2_243">Reasons that treat God as a social function</h2>
    <h3 id="H3_244">Sociological explanations of religion</h3>
    <p id="P_245">Some people think that religions and belief in God
        fulfil functions in human society, rather than being the result of
        God actually existing.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_246">Ludwig Feuerbach</h3>
    <p id="P_247">Ludwig Feuerbach was a 19th century German
        philosopher who proposed that religion was just a human being's
        consciousness of the infinite.</p>
    <p id="P_248">He said that human ideas about God were no more
        than the projection of humanity's ideas about man onto an imaginary
        supernatural being.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_249">Emile Durkheim</h3>
    <p id="P_250">Emile Durkheim (1858-1917), a French sociologist,
        thought that religion was something produced by human society, and
        had nothing supernatural about it.</p>

    <p id="P_257">He believed that religion existed, but he did not
        agree that the reality that lay behind it was the same reality that
        believers thought existed.</p>
    <p id="P_258">Religion helped people to form close knit groups,
        in which they could find a place in society. Religious rituals
        created mental states in those taking part which were helpful to the
        group.</p>
    <p id="P_259">To put it another way; religious rituals do not do
        anything other than strengthen the beliefs of the group taking part
        and reinforce the collective consciousness.</p>
    <p id="P_260">Religion fulfilled the functions of:</p>
    <ul id="UL_261">
        <li id="LI_262">Giving a meaning and purpose to life</li>
        <li id="LI_263">Binding people together in groups</li>
        <li id="LI_264">Supporting the moral code of the group</li>
        <li id="LI_265">Supporting the social code of the group</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="P_266">Durkheim thought that this was enough to give
        people a feeling that there was something supernatural going on.</p>

                pressure exercises itself, it could not fail to give men the idea
                that outside themselves there exist one or several powers, both
                moral and, at the same time, efficacious, upon which they depend.

    <p id="P_273">Durkheim said that religious beliefs divided
        experiences into the profane and the sacred - the profane were the
        routine experiences of everyday life, while the sacred were beyond
        the everyday and likely to inspire reverence.</p>
    <p id="P_274">Objects could become sacred, not because of any
        inherent supernatural resonance but because the group fixed certain
        'collective ideals' on an object.</p>

    <h2 id="H2_280">Karl Marx's criticisms of religion</h2>
    <h3 id="H3_281">Marx's view of religion</h3>
    <p id="P_282">Karl Marx thought that religion was an illusion,
        with no real God or supernatural reality standing in the background.
        Religion was a force that stopped human societies from changing.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_283">A social institution</h3>
    <p id="P_284">Marx believed that religion was a social
        institution, and reflected and sustained the particular society in
        which it flourished.</p>
    <p id="P_285">He went further. Religion was a tool used by the
        capitalists to keep the working-class under control.</p>
    <p id="P_286">Religion provided the working-class with comfort in
        their miserable oppressed circumstances, and by focussing attention
        on the joys to come after death, it distracted the workers from
        trying to make this life better.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_287">Religion cheats human beings</h3>
    <p id="P_288">Furthermore, it took the noblest human ideals and
        gave them to a non-existent God, thus cheating human beings of
        realising their own greatness and potential.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_289">Religion disguises the true wrongs</h3>
    <p id="P_290">Marx argued that the illusory happiness provided by
        religion should be eliminated by putting right the economic
        conditions that caused people to need this illusion to make their
        lives bearable.</p>
    <p id="P_291">Religion was like a pain-killer (hence Marx's
        famous reference to it as "the opium of the people"), but what was
        needed was to cure the sickness, not sedate the patient.</p>
    <div class="promo_quote_box_top" id="DIV_292">
        <blockquote id="BLOCKQUOTE_293">
            <p id="P_294">Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature,
                the feelings of a heartless world, just as it is the spirit of
                unspiritual conditions. It is the opium of the people.</p>

    <div class="promo_quote_box_bottom" id="DIV_295"></div>
    <h3 id="H3_296">Target: Christianity</h3>
    <p id="P_297">The Marxist analysis of religion was principally
        aimed at Christianity as Christianity was the dominant faith in the
        industrial societies which Marx was criticising.</p>

    <h2 id="H2_303">God is not apparent</h2>
    <h3 id="H3_304">God is Loving</h3>
    <p id="P_305">This is one of the more unusual arguments used to
        show that God can't exist:</p>
    <p id="P_306">God is perfectly loving</p>
    <p id="P_307">God knows that human beings would be happier if
        they were aware of the existence of a loving God</p>
    <p id="P_308">So if such a God existed, he would make sure that
        everyone knew it</p>
    <p id="P_309">There are lots of people who aren't aware of the
        existence of a loving God. Therefore such a God does not exist</p>
