    <h2>Conquest</h2>
    <h3>The early rise of Islam (632-700)</h3>
    <p>The Muslim community spread through the Middle East
        through conquest, and the resulting growth of the Muslim state
        provided the ground in which the recently revealed faith could take
        root and flourish.</p>
    <p>The military conquest was inspired by religion, but
        it was also motivated by greed and politics.</p>
    <div>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Men fought for their religion, the prospect of
                booty and because their friends and fellow tribesmen were also
                doing it.</p>
            <p>
                <cite>Hugh Kennedy, The Armies of the Caliphs:
                    Military and Society in the Early Islamic State, 2001</cite>
            </p>
        </blockquote>
    </div>

    <p>But this mixture of motives combined to form a
        process that forged Islamic and Arab ideals and communities into a
        fast-growing religious and political identity.</p>

    <h3>The history problem</h3>
    <p>There are many accounts from the period about the
        early Muslim conquests, but much of the material is unreliable and
        written to present things in a way that glorified the victors and
        their God...</p>
    <div>
        <blockquote>
            <p>As explanations for the great events of the
                seventh century these are at best partial. This is not to say that
                the Muslims were not brave and that the conviction that they were
                doing Allah's will was not significant: it clearly was. But their
                opponents also had firm ideological commitments and there is no
                reason to assume that individuals were likely to be any less
                brave. Despite the great mass of words, the full explanation for
                Muslim victory still eludes us.</p>

    <h3>Conversion by conquest?</h3>
    <p>The early advance of Islam went hand in hand with
        military expansion - whether it was the motivation for it is
        difficult to tell, although one recent book suggests that Islam
        certainly facilitated the growth of Muslim power.</p>
    <div>
        <blockquote>
            <p>...only one possible explanation remains for the
                Arab success-and that was the spirit of Islam... The generous
                terms that the invading armies usually offered made their faith
                accessible to the conquered populations. And if it was a new and
                upstart faith, its administration by simple and honest men was
                preferable to the corruption and persecution that were the norm in
                more civilized empires...</p>

            </p>
        </blockquote>
    </div>
    <p>And Islam benefited greatly from the astonishing military success of the armies of Arabia...</p>
    <div>
        <blockquote>
            <p>the real victor in the conquests was not the Arab
                warlords, but Islam itself... Simply put, Islam may have sped the
                conquests, but it also showed much greater staying power. It is
                useful to realize that the power of Islam was separate from much
                and more permanent than that of the armies with which it rode.</p>

    <p>But the Arab military adventures do not seem to have been intended as a religious war of conversion.</p>
    <div>
        <blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p>In the wake of the Ridda wars, and of the Arabs'
                sudden conquest of most of the Near East, the new religion became
                identified more sharply as a monotheism for the Arab people.</p>
            <p>As is well known, the Arabs made no attempt to
                impose their faith on their new subjects, and at first in fact
                discouraged conversions on the part of non-Arabs.</p>

    <h3 id="H3_50">The justification of conquest</h3>
    <p id="P_51">
        Whether or not Islam provided the motivation for early Muslim
        imperialism, it could be used to provide justification for it - in
        the same way that it had previously been used to support Muhammad's own actions against his opponents.
    </p>
    <p id="P_53">
        The Qur'an has a number of passages that support military action against non-Muslims, for example:
    </p>
    <div class="promo_quote_box_top" id="DIV_56">
        <blockquote id="BLOCKQUOTE_57">
            <p id="P_58">But when the forbidden months are past, then fight
                and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them,
                beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of
                war)...</p>
            <p id="P_59">
                <cite id="CITE_60">from Qur'an 9:5</cite>

    </div>

    <div>
        <blockquote id="BLOCKQUOTE_63">
            <p id="P_64">Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last
                Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah
                and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if
                they are) of the People of the Book...</p>

    <div class="promo_quote_box_bottom" id="DIV_67"></div>
    <p id="P_68">Other passages confirmed the rightness of the
        ancient military tradition of looting from the defeated, and
        specified how the booty should be divided.</p>
    <p id="P_69">This is not surprising, as the armies of those days
        were not like modern armies - but more like a federation of tribal
        mercenary groups who were not paid and whose only material reward
        came from the spoils of war.</p>

    <h3 id="H3_76">Islam as a political force</h3>
    <p id="P_77">The political status of Islam, and the role Muhammad
        had given it as a political as well as a religious force, was
        reinforced in the military conquests.</p>
    <div class="promo_quote_box_top" id="DIV_78">
        <blockquote id="BLOCKQUOTE_79">
            <p id="P_80">A caliph such as Umar seems to have regarded

    <h3 id="H3_84">The conquest of Arabia</h3>
    <p id="P_85">After the death of Muhammad in 632 CE, the young
        Muslim federation came under strain. Some of the tribes decided that
        as their loyalty to Islam had been primarily to Muhammad himself,
        his death allowed them to end their allegiance to Mecca and to
        Islam.</p>
    <p id="P_86">To make things more difficult, the Prophet had not
        left clear instructions as to who should lead the community after
        his death.</p>
    <p id="P_87">
        Fortunately the community immediately chose the Prophet's close
        companion and father-in-Law Abu Bakr, as his successor. Abu Bakr was
        known as the first caliph (from <em id="EM_88">khalifa</em>, the
        Arabic for successor).
    </p>
    <p id="P_89">
        Abu Bakr took swift military action against the communities that
        wanted to break away. These campaigns, known as the apostasy or <em
            id="EM_90">ridda</em> wars, effectively consolidated Arabia into a
        single country under Muslim control within two years.
    </p>
    <h3 id="H3_91">Expansion in the Middle East</h3>
    <p id="P_92">Abu Bakr died in 634 and was succeeded by Umar ibn
        al-Khattab, the second caliph, who ruled until 644. Umar found
        himself the ruler of a large unified state, with an organised army,
        and he used this as a tool to spread Islam further in the Middle
        East.</p>
    <p id="P_93">Umar's early campaigns were against the Byzantine
        Empire. Following the decisive Battle of Yarmouk in 636, the former
        Byzantine states of Syria, Palestine, and Lebanon were conquered by
        the Muslim armies.</p>
    <p id="P_94">
        Shortly afterwards the Muslim army attacked the Sassanid Empire in Iraq, gaining a massive victory in
        637 at the Battle of Qadasiya, and gradually conquering more and
        more of Iraq over the next dozen years.
    </p>
    <p id="P_96">This conquest was made much easier by the weakness
        of the Sassanid Empire, which was wounded by internal conflicts and
        a lengthy war with the Byzantine Empire.</p>
    <p id="P_97">Within a few years the Muslims had also conquered
        parts of Egypt to the South and Anatolia and Armenia to the North.</p>
