    <h3 id="H3_6">Moksha</h3>
    <p id="P_7">Hindus believe that the soul passes through a cycle
        of successive lives (samsara) and its next incarnation is always
        dependent on how the previous life was lived (karma).</p>

    <p id="P_12">In a lifetime people build up karma, both good and
        bad, based on their actions within that lifetime. This karma affects
        their future lives and existences. People must take responsibility
        for their actions either within this life time or the next. Death is
        a key part of this cycle and is treated with specific importance.
        Death is the last samsara (cycle of life) referred to as the 'last
        sacrifice'.</p>
    <p id="P_13">
        Moksha is the end of the death and rebirth cycle and is classed as
        the fourth and ultimate <em id="EM_14">artha</em> (goal). It is the
        transcendence of all arthas. It is achieved by overcoming ignorance
        and desires. It is a paradox in the sense that overcoming desires
        also includes overcoming the desire for moksha itself. It can be
        achieved both in this life and after death.

    <h3 id="H3_18">What happens after death</h3>
    <p id="P_19">It is preferable for a Hindu to die at home.
        Traditionally a candle is lit by the head of the deceased. The body
        is then placed in the entranceway of the house with the head facing
        south. The body is bathed, anointed with sandalwood, shaved (if
        male) and wrapped in cloth. It is preferable for cremation to take
        place on the day of death. The body is then carried to the funeral
        pyre by the male relatives and prayers are said to Yama, the god of
        death. Sometimes the name of God (Ram) is chanted. While doing this
        the pyre is circled three times anti-clockwise. This is usually done
        by the male relatives of the family, lead by the chief mourner.</p>
    <p id="P_20">On the funeral pyre the feet of the body are
        positioned pointing south in the direction of the realm of Yama and
        the head positioned north towards the realm of Kubera, the god of
        wealth. Traditionally it is the chief mourner who sets light to the
        pyre. This is done by accepting flaming kusha twigs from the Doms'
        who are part of the Untouchable Hindu caste responsible for tending
        to funeral pyres. The body is now an offering to Agni, the god of
        fire.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_21">Water is sacred</h3>
    <p id="P_22">After cremation the ashes are collected and usually
        scattered in water. The River Ganges is considered the most sacred
        place to scatter ashes. Similarly, Benares (the home of Siva, Lord
        of destruction) is a preferred place of death because it takes the
        pollution out of death and makes it a positive event. Anyone who
        dies here breaks the cycle of life and achieves moksha
        (enlightenment or release).</p>
    <p id="P_23">It is important to remember that Hinduism is not
        only a religion but also a cultural way of life. Some practices and
        beliefs may not be common to all Hindus as regional differences
        occur.</p>
