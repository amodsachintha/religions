    <p id="P_11">Hinduism's early history is the subject of much
        debate for a number of reasons.</p>
    <p id="P_12">Firstly, in a strict sense there was no 'Hinduism'
        before modern times, although the sources of Hindu traditions are
        very ancient.</p>
    <p id="P_13">Secondly, Hinduism is not a single religion but
        embraces many traditions.</p>
    <p id="P_14">Thirdly, Hinduism has no definite starting point.
        The traditions which flow into Hinduism may go back several thousand
        years and some practitioners claim that the Hindu revelation is
        eternal.</p>
    <p id="P_15">Although there is an emphasis on personal
        spirituality, Hinduism's history is closely linked with social and
        political developments, such as the rise and fall of different
        kingdoms and empires. The early history of Hinduism is difficult to
        date and Hindus themselves tend to be more concerned with the
        substance of a story or text rather than its date.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_16">Hindu notions of time</h3>
    <p id="P_17">
        Hindus in general believe that time is cyclical, much like the four
        seasons, and eternal rather than linear and bounded. Texts refer to
        successive ages (<em id="EM_18">yuga</em>), designated respectively
        as golden, silver, copper and iron.
    </p>
    <p id="P_19">
        During the golden age people were pious and adhered to dharma (law, duty, truth) but its power diminishes
        over time until it has to be reinvigorated through divine
        intervention.
    </p>
    <p id="P_21">
        With each successive age, good qualities diminish, until we reach
        the current iron or dark age (<em id="EM_22">kali yuga</em>) marked
        by cruelty, hypocrisy, materialism and so on. Such ideas challenge
        the widespread, linear view that humans are inevitably progressing.
    </p>
    <h3 id="H3_23">Main historical periods</h3>
    <p id="P_24">Although the early history of Hinduism is difficult
        to date with certainty, the following list presents a rough
        chronology.</p>

    <h2 id="H2_45">Indus Valley Civilisation</h2>
    <h3 id="H3_46">The Indus Valley Civilisation (before 2000 BCE)</h3>
    <span class="image_with_caption float_right" id="SPAN_47"><img
            alt="Satellite image of Indus river basin with modern international boundaries marked"
            height="190"

            width="140" id="IMG_48"/> <span class="caption" id="SPAN_49">The
        Indus basin
			</span></span>
    <p id="P_51">The Indus Valley civilisation was located in the
        basin of the river Indus, which flows through present day Pakistan.
        It had developed by about 2500 BCE although its origins reach back
        to the Neolithic period. It had faded away by 1500 BCE.</p>
    <p id="P_52">The Indus Valley was a developed urban culture akin
        to the civilisations of Mesopotamia. Two major cities have been
        uncovered, Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa, which has given us the
        alternative name of Harappan culture. These cities housed about
        40,000 people who enjoyed quite a high standard of living with
        sophisticated water systems; most houses having drainage systems,
        wells, and rubbish chutes. Grain was the basis of the economy and
        large grain stores collected grain as tax.</p>
    <p id="P_53">The civilisation was extensive, from the eastern
        foothills of the Himalayas, to Lothar on the Gujarat coast, and to
        Sutgagen Dor near the Iranian border. Some cities of the Indus
        valley culture have yet to be excavated.</p>
    <p id="P_54">The Indus civilisation did not develop as a result
        of contact with other civilisations such as Sumer or Egypt but was
        an indigenous development growing out of earlier, local cultures.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_55">Religion in the Indus valley</h3>
    <p id="P_56">We know little of the religion, social structure or
        politics of this early civilisation and we do not know the language,
        but seals have been found with what looks like a script inscribed on
        them. This has not been deciphered successfully and some scholars
        now question whether it is in fact a script, although this is
        contentious.</p>
    <span class="image_with_caption float_left" id="SPAN_57"><img
            alt="Abstract, gently curving carving of seated male torso and arms, the head broken off"
            height="180"

            width="120" id="IMG_58"/> <span class="caption" id="SPAN_59">Male

			</span></span>
    <p id="P_61">Religion in the Indus valley seems to have involved
        temple rituals and ritual bathing in the 'great bath' found at
        Mohenjo-Daro. There is some evidence of animal sacrifice at
        Kalibangan. A number of terracotta figurines have been found,
        perhaps goddess images, and a seal depicting a seated figure
        surrounded by animals that some scholars thought to be a prototype
        of the god Shiva. Others have disputed this, pointing out that it
        bears a close resemblance to Elamite seals depicting seated bulls.
        One image, carved on soapstone (steatite), depicts a figure battling
        with lions which is reminiscent of the Mesopotamian Gilgamesh myth.
    </p>
    <p id="P_62">There may be continuities between the Indus Valley
        civilisation and later Hinduism as suggested by the apparent
        emphasis on ritual bathing, sacrifice, and goddess worship. But
        ritual purity, sacrifice and an emphasis on fertility are common to
        other ancient religions.</p>

    <h2 id="H2_68">Vedic Period</h2>
    <h3 id="H3_69">The Vedic Period (c.1500–c.500 BCE)</h3>
    <p id="P_70">There have been two major theories about the early
        development of early south Asian traditions.</p>
    <ol id="OL_71">
        <li id="LI_72">The Aryan migration thesis that the Indus Valley
            groups calling themselves 'Aryans' (noble ones) migrated into the
            sub-continent and became the dominant cultural force. Hinduism, on
            this view, derives from their religion recorded in the Veda along
            with elements of the indigenous traditions they encountered.
        </li>
        <li id="LI_73">The cultural transformation thesis that Aryan
            culture is a development of the Indus Valley culture. On this view
            there were no Aryan migrations (or invasion) and the Indus valley
            culture was an Aryan or vedic culture.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p id="P_74">There are two sources of knowledge about this
        ancient period - language and archaeology - and we can make two
        comments about them. Firstly, the language of vedic culture was
        vedic Sanskrit, which is related to other languages in the
        Indo-European language group. This suggests that Indo-European
        speakers had a common linguistic origin known by scholars as
        Proto-Indo-European.</p>
    <span class="image_with_caption float_right" id="SPAN_75"><img
            alt="Sanskrit manuscript" height="180"
            src="file:///android_asset/religions/hinduism/history/images/rigvedasanskrit.jpg"
            width="435" id="IMG_76"/> <span class="caption" id="SPAN_77">Page
					of the Rig Veda in Sanskrit: early 19th century Indian manuscript
			</span></span>
    <p id="P_79">Secondly, there does seem to be archaeological
        continuity in the subcontinent from the Neolithic period. The
        history of this period is therefore complex. One of the key problems
        is that no horse remains have been found in the Indus Valley but in
        the Veda the horse sacrifice is central. The debate is ongoing.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_80">Vedic religion</h3>
    <p id="P_81">
        If we take 'Vedic Period' to refer to the period when the Vedas were composed, we can say that early vedic
        religion centred around the sacrifice and sharing the sacrificial
        meal with each other and with the many gods (<em id="EM_84">devas</em>). The term
        'sacrifice' (<em id="EM_85">homa</em>, <em id="EM_86">yajna</em>) is
        not confined to offering animals but refers more widely to any
        offering into the sacred fire (such as milk and clarified butter).
    </p>
    <p id="P_87">
        Some of the vedic rituals were very elaborate and continue to the
        present day. Sacrifice was offered to different vedic gods (<em
            id="EM_88">devas</em>) who lived in different realms of a
        hierarchical universe divided into three broad realms: earth,
        atmosphere and sky.
    </p>
    <p id="P_89">
        Earth contains the plant god Soma, the fire god Agni, and the god of
        priestly power, Brhaspati. The Atmosphere contains the warrior
        Indra, the wind Vayu, the storm gods or Maruts and the terrible
        Rudra. The Sky contains the sky god Dyaus (from the same root as
        Zeus), the Lord of cosmic law (or <em id="EM_90">rta</em>) Varuna,
        his friend the god of night Mitra, the nourisher Pushan, and the
        pervader Vishnu.
    </p>

    <h2 id="H2_96">Epic, Puranic and Classical Age</h2>
    <h3 id="H3_97">The Epic, Puranic and Classical Age (c.500
        BCE–500 CE)</h3>
    <span class="image_with_caption float_left" id="SPAN_98"><img

			</span></span>
    <p id="P_102">
        This period, beginning from around the time of Buddha (died c. 400
        BCE), saw the composition of further texts, the <em id="EM_104">Dharma Sutras</em> and <em
            id="EM_105">Shastras</em>, the two Epics, the <em id="EM_106">Mahabharata</em>
        and the <em id="EM_107">Ramayana</em>, and subsequently the <em
            id="EM_108">Puranas</em>, containing many of the stories still
        popular today. The famous <em id="EM_109">Bhagavad Gita</em> is part
        of the <em id="EM_110">Mahabharata</em>.
    </p>
    <p id="P_111">
        The idea of dharma (law, duty, truth) which is central to
        Hinduism was expressed in a genre of texts known as Dharma Sutras
        and Shastras. The Dharma Sutras recognise three sources of dharma:
        revelation (i.e. the Veda), tradition (<em id="EM_113">smrti</em>),
        and good custom. The <em id="EM_114">Laws of Manu</em> adds 'what is
        pleasing to oneself'.
    </p>
    <p id="P_115">
        During this period the vedic fire sacrifice became minimised with
        the development of devotional worship (<em id="EM_117">puja</em>) to images of
        deities in temples. The rise of the Gupta Empire (320-500 CE) saw
        the development of the great traditions of Vaishnavism (focussed on
        Vishnu), Shaivism (focussed on Shiva) and Shaktism (focussed on Devi).
    </p>
    <p id="P_120">
        From this period we can recognise many elements in present day
        Hinduism, such as <em id="EM_121">bhakti</em> (devotion) and temple
        worship. This period saw the development of poetic literature. These
        texts were composed in Sanskrit, which became the most important
        element in a shared culture.
    </p>

    <h2 id="H2_127">Medieval Period</h2>
    <h3 id="H3_128">Medieval Period (500 CE–1500 CE)</h3>
    <span class="image_with_caption float_right" id="SPAN_129"><img
            alt="Pyramidal granite temple covered with sculpture and statues"

			</span></span>
    <p id="P_133">
        From 500 CE we have the rise of devotion (<em id="EM_134">bhakti</em>)
        to the major deities, particularly Vishnu, Shiva and Devi. With
        the collapse of the Gupta empire, regional kingdoms developed which
        patronised different religions. For example, the Cholas in the South
        supported Shaivism.
    </p>
    <p id="P_136">This period saw the development of the great
        regional temples such as Jagganatha in Puri in Orissa, the Shiva
        temple in Cidambaram in Tamilnadu, and the Shiva temple in Tanjavur,
        also in Tamilnadu. All of these temples had a major deity installed
        there and were centres of religious and political power.</p>
    <h3 id="H3_137">Poet-saints and gurus</h3>
    <p id="P_138">During this time not only religious literature in
        Sanskrit developed but also in vernacular languages, particularly
        Tamil. Here poet-saints recorded their devotional sentiments. Most
        notable are the twelve Vaishnava Alvars (6th–9th centuries),
        including one famous female poet-saint called Andal, and the
        sixty-three Shaiva Nayanars (8th–10th centuries).</p>
    <p id="P_139">
        Subsequent key thinkers and teachers (<em id="EM_140">acharyas
        or</em> <em id="EM_141">gurus</em>) consolidated these teachings. They
        formulated new theologies, perpetuated by their own disciplic
        successions (<em id="EM_142">sampradaya</em>).
    </p>
    <p id="P_143">
        Shankara (780–820) travelled widely, defeating scholars of the
        unorthodox movements, Buddhism and Jainism, which around the turn of
        the millennium had established prominent seats of learning
        throughout India. He re-established the authority of the Vedic
        canon, propagated <em id="EM_144">advaita</em> (monism) and laid
        foundations for the further development of the tradition known as
        the Vedanta.
    </p>
    <span class="image_with_caption float_left" id="SPAN_145"><img
            alt="The philosopher Madhva seated" height="160"

			</span></span>
    <h3 id="H3_149">Developments in Vaishnavism and Shaivism</h3>
    <p id="P_150">The Vaishnava philosophers Ramanuja (c. 1017–1137),
        Madhva (13th cent) and others followed, writing their own scriptural
        commentaries, propounding new theologies and establishing their own
        successions. Ramanuja qualified Shankara's impersonal philosophy,
        and Madhva more strongly propounded the existence of a personal God.
    </p>
    <p id="P_151">Shaivism similarly developed during this period
        with important philosophers such as Abhinavagupta (c. 975–1025)
        writing commentaries on the Tantras, an alternative revelation to
        the Veda, and other texts.</p>
    <p id="P_152">The Tantras became revered as a revelation that
        fulfilled or superseded the Veda. Some of these texts advocated
        ritually polluting practices such as offering alcohol, meat and
        ritualised sex to ferocious deities but most of these texts are
        simply concerned with daily and occasional rituals, temple building,
        cosmology and so on.</p>

    <h2 id="H2_158">Pre-Modern Period</h2>
    <h3 id="H3_159">The Pre-Modern Period (c.1500–1757 CE)</h3>

    <p id="P_164">Alongside the development of Hindu traditions, most
        widespread in the South, was the rise of Islam in the North as a
        religious and political force in India. The new religion of Islam
        reached Indian shores around the 8th century, via traders plying the
        Arabian Sea and the Muslim armies which conquered the northwest
        provinces.</p>
    <p id="P_165">Muslim political power began with the Turkish
        Sultanate around 1200 CE and culminated in the Mughul Empire (from
        1526). Akbar (1542–1605) was a liberal emperor and allowed Hindus to
        practice freely. However, his great grandson, Aurangzeb (1618–1707),
        destroyed many temples and restricted Hindu practice.</p>
    <p id="P_166">
        During this period we have further developments in devotional
        religion (<em id="EM_167">bhakti</em>). The Sant tradition in the
        North, mainly in Maharashtra and the Panjab, expressed devotion in
        poetry to both a god without qualities (<em id="EM_168">nirguna</em>)
        and to a god with qualities (<em id="EM_169">saguna</em>) such as
        parental love of his devotees.
    </p>
    <p id="P_170">The Sant tradition combines elements of bhakti,
        meditation or yoga, and Islamic mysticism. Even today the poetry of
        the princess Mirabai, and other saints such as Tukaram, Surdas and
        Dadu are popular.</p>
