        <small>The Bible is the basis of Christian beliefs</small>
    </p>

    <p>Christians believe that there is only one God, whom they call Father as Jesus Christ taught them.</p>

    <h3>Jesus</h3>
    <p>Christians recognise Jesus as the Son of God who was sent to save mankind from death and sin.</p>
    <p>Jesus Christ taught that he was Son of God. His teachings can be summarised, briefly as the love of God and love of one's neighbour.</p>
    <p>Jesus said that he had come to fulfil God's law rather than teach it.</p>

    <h3>Justification by faith</h3>
    <p>Christians believe in justification by faith - that through their belief in Jesus as the Son of God, and in his death and resurrection, they can have a right relationship with God whose
        forgiveness was made once and for all through the death of Jesus Christ.</p>

    <h3>The Trinity</h3>
    <p>Christians believe in the Trinity - that is, in God as Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</p>
    <p>Some confuse this and think that Christians believe in three separate gods, which they don't.</p>
    <p>Christians believe that God took human form as Jesus Christ and that God is present today through the work of the Holy Spirit and evident in the actions of believers.</p>

    <h3>Life after death</h3>
    <p>Christians believe that there is a life after earthly death.</p>
    <p>While the actual nature of this life is not known, Christians believe that many spiritual experiences in this life help to give them some idea of what eternal life will be like.</p>

    <h3>The Saints</h3>
    <p>These days, the word saint is most commonly used to refer to a Christian who has lived a particularly good and holy life on earth, and with whom miracles are claimed to have been associated
        after their death.</p>
    <p>The formal title of Saint is conferred by the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches through a process called <em>canonisation</em>.</p>
    <p>Members of these Churches also believe that Saints
        created in this way can intercede with God on behalf of people who
        are alive today. This is not accepted by most Protestants.</p>
    <p>
        In the Bible, however, the word saint is used as a
        description of anyone who is a committed believer, particularly by St. Paul in the New Testament (e.g. Ephesians 1.1. and 1.15).

    <h3 id="H3_43">Prayer</h3>

        <small>Candles lit in church during Christian prayer</small>
    </p>

    <p>Prayer is the means by which Christians communicate with their God.</p>
    <p>The New Testament records that Jesus taught his disciples how to pray and that he
        encouraged them to address God as <em>Father</em>.
        Christians believe that they continue this tradition.
    </p>
    <p>Sometimes the prayers are formal and part of a ritual laid down for hundreds of years.</p>
    <p>Others are personal and spontaneous, and come from personal or group need.</p>
    <p>Whilst prayer is often directed to God as Father, as taught by Jesus, some traditions encourage prayer to God through intermediaries such as saints and martyrs.</p>
    <p>Prayers through Mary, as the mother of God, are central to some churches and form a traditional part of their worship.
    </p>
    <h3>The Church</h3>
    <p>The Christian church is fundamental to believers. Although it has many faults it is recognised as God's body on earth.
    </p>
    <p>The church is the place where the Christian faith is nurtured and where the Holy Spirit is manifest on earth.</p>
    <p>It is where Christians are received into the faith and where they are brought together into one body through the Eucharist.</p>

    <h3>Baptism</h3>
    <p>The Christian church believes in one <em>baptism</em>into the Christian church, whether this be as an infant or as an adult, as an outward sign of an inward commitment to the teachings of
        Jesus.</p>

    <h3>Eucharist</h3>
    <p><em>Eucharist</em> is a Greek word for thanksgiving. Its celebration is to commemorate the final meal that Jesus took with his disciples before his death (the Last Supper).</p>
    <p>This rite comes from the actions of Jesus who, at that meal, took bread and wine and asked his disciples to consume them and continue to do so in memory of him.</p>
    <p>
        <img
                alt="Christian priest's hand holding thin, white Communion wafers"
                class="img-fluid"
                src="file:///android_asset/religions/christianity/beliefs/images/wafers.jpg"/>
    </p>
    <p>At the meal, the wine represented his blood and the
        bread his body.</p>
    <p>The Eucharist (also known as a Communion meal in
        some churches) is central to the Church and is recognised as a sign
        of unity amongst Christians.</p>
    <p>Different Churches understand and practice the
        Eucharist in different ways. As a result, the central ideas of the
        Eucharist can cause disharmony rather than unity.</p>
    <p>For example, the idea that Christ is present in the
        bread and wine is interpreted literally by some churches and
        metaphorically by others. This has given rise to substantial and
        often irreconcilable disagreement.</p>

    <h3>Christian beliefs concerning God</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>There is only one God</li>
        <li>God is a Trinity of Father, Son and Holy Spirit</li>

        <li>God intervenes in the universe</li>

            people have to comply with various conditions in order to achieve
            salvation)
        </li>
        <li>Human beings can get to know God through prayer, worship, love, and mystical experiences</li>
        <li>Human beings can get to know God through God's grace - that is through his love and his power</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>God the Son</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>God lived on earth as Jesus</li>
        <li>Jesus was both wholly God and wholly human</li>
        <li>Jesus was born to a human woman, Mary, but conceived of the Holy Spirit</li>
        <li>Because Jesus was wholly human he was subject to pain, suffering, and sorrow like other human beings</li>
        <li>Jesus was executed by crucifixion but rose from the dead at the <em>Resurrection</em></li>
        <li>Jesus's life provides a perfect example of how God wants people to live</li>
        <li> Jesus died on the Cross so that those who believe in him will be forgiven all their sins</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>God the Holy Spirit</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>After the Resurrection, Jesus remained on earth for only a few days before going up into Heaven</li>
        <li>Jesus promised that he would stay with his followers, so after he went to Heaven he sent his Spirit to guide them</li>
        <li>The Holy Spirit continues to guide, comfort, and encourage Christians</li>
    </ul>
